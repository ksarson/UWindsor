Step 1:  Requirements Definition

Write a program by going through the 6 problem solving steps that reads in the
lenght and with of rectangular yard in feet, the length and width of a rectangular
house located in the yard in feet, and calculates and displays the time required
to cut the grass in the yard at a rate of 2 square feet per second (we assume that
the part of the yard that is not covered by the house is covered by grass and needs
to be cut).  The computed time has to be given in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.  
Your program should also print the areas (length * width) of (i) the yard, (ii) the
house, and (iii) the grass area in both square feet and square meters.  Your program 
is also required to print the perimeter (2 * (length + width)) of (i) the yard and 
(ii) the house in both feet and meters.  Note that 1 foot is equal to 0.3048 meters.


Step 2: Components Analysis

Input Data:		yardL, yardW (real)
				houseL, houseW (real)

Output Data:	hours, minutes, seconds (real)
				yardAF, yardAM (real)
				houseAF, houseAM (real)
				grassAF, grassAM (real)
				yardPF, yardPM (real)
				housePF, housePM (real)

Other Data:		totalseconds (real)

Relationships:	hours = totalseconds / 360
				minutes = (totalseconds % 360) / 60
				seconds = (totalseconds % 360) % 60
				yardAF = yardL * yardW
				yardAM = (yardL * 0.3048) * (yardW * 0.3048)
				houseAF = houseL * houseW
				houseAM = (houseL * 0.3048) * (houseW * 0.3048)
				grassAF = yardAF - houseAF
				grassAM = yardAM - houseAM
				yardPF = 2 * (yardL + yardW)
				yardPM = 2 * ((yardL * 0.3048) + (yardW * 0.3048))
				housePF = 2 * (houseL + houseW)
				housePM = 2 * ((houseL * 0.3048) + (houseW * 0.3048))
