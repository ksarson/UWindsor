        	If (a < b) is false, then (a >= b) must be true in a total linear order.
        	Thus, (b < a)â€™s valuation can be true (if a != b) or false (if a == b).
        	A total linear order requires if !(a <= b) then (b <= a)

        When (a < b) is false and the semantic rules applied to < are those of a strict weak order, then does that
        logically imply or constrain in any way the possible result(s) of the valuation of (b < a)? Explain. [4 marks]
        	If (a < b) is false under SWO, this implies nothing about (b < a) which can also be false.
        	(The reverse is not true, if (a < b) is true, then (b < a) must be false.)
        	This is why equivalence is defined as !(a < b) && !(b < a).

/* 
Concerning Part II:
Ensure you can write constructors, member functions, operator overloads, etc. 
--including the specially named constructors and the stream I/O bitshift operator overloads.
Part II asks you to write the code for a container class. You are provided the type aliases (typedefs) required, e.g., iterator, 
as well as the definitions of begin() and end() for this class to be a container class (assuming all of the code you write is present). 
So your task is straight-forward to do. The data structure is very well-known, i.e., it is one you are all very familiar with, 
and Part II is similar to code you've seen and have been asked to write before. This is a snippet of some of the provided code in Part II (do try writing some code as part of your studying):
  using value_type = double;
  using size_type = std::size_t;
  using reference = value_type&;
  using const_reference = value_type const&;
  using difference_type = std::ptrdiff_t;
  using iterator = double*;
  using const_iterator = double const*;
  iterator begin() { return ptr_; }
  const_iterator begin() const { return ptr_; }
  const_iterator cbegin() const { return ptr_; }
  iterator end() { return ptr_ ? ptr_+size_ : ptr_; }
  const_iterator end() const { return ptr_ ? ptr_+size_ : ptr_; }
  const_iterator cend() const { return ptr_ ? ptr_+size_ : ptr_; }
